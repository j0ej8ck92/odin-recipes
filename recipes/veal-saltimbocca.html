    <p class="para">Veal cutlets wrapped in crispy, salty prosciutto and fragrant sage leaves. A classic Roman Dish that's pan-fried until they're juicy, tender and incredibly delicious. A simple and elegant meal thats great served with potatoes, asparagus or salad.</p>

    <h2 class="head_2">Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>6 veal cutlets</li>
      <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
      <li>6 slices prosciutto</li>
      <li>6 large sageleaves</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (125ml) white wine</li>
      <li>2 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
      <li>6 toothpicks, to secure the cutlets</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="instruct">Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Place the veal cutlets between two sheets of plastic wrap (cling film) and gently beat with a rolling pin or meat mallet until 1/4 of an inch thin.</li>
      <li>Place a slice of prosciutto over each cutlet followed by a sage leaf. Secure everything together using a small wooden skewer.</li>
      <li>Dip the cutlets in flour on each side and shake gently to get rid of excess flour. Heat olive oil in a large pan or skillet and fry on each side until slightly crispy and browned. Remove from the pan and add wine to deglaze the pan. </li>
      <li>Scrap all the brown bits and stir until reduced by half, return the veal to the pan to heat through then serve.</li>
    </ol>
