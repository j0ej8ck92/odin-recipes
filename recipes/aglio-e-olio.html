    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A simple, traditional, classic Italian pasta dish that offers a rich, nutty, and slightly sweet garlic flavor. The garlic is slowly and gently toasted to golden perfection in high-quality extra virgin olive oil. This infused oil, when emulsified with starchy, salty pasta water, formas a light, glossy, and savory sauce that perfectly coats the noodles.</p>
